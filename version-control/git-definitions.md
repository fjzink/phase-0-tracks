# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control tracks changes to your code and allows you to revert back to previous version as desired. This is useful because if you make a change that causes a problem you can always revert back to previous version which you know works and does not have issues.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is basically another copy of the repository you are working on. You can make changes and commits to it independently of the master branch, and branches can be merged to combine their code as desired. This is useful because it allows you to work on code without affecting the master branch, and this allows multiple developers working on the same project to be working on different features independently of one another with affecting the base code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit saves changes made to code in a particular branch, and this allows you to create new versions of a branch which you can revert back to. A good commit message clearly describes what changes were made in the version being committed.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two branches that are being merged contain changes to the same line of code. When this happens Git does not know which code is correct and lets you know that there is a conflict.
