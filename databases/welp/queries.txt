=====RELEASE 2: VIEW A MANY-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIP=====

2.  You've joined two tables before.  How do you join three?
-----COMMAND-----
SELECT * FROM reviews
JOIN businesses
ON reviews.busisness_id = businesses.id
JOIN users
ON reviews.users_id = users.id
;
-----OUTPUT-----
1|4|Pretty good.|1|1|1|The Beagle Nightclub|1|Bradford|Pitt
2|3|ok|2|1|2|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|Bradford|Pitt
3|5|Amazing!|3|3|3|Lotus Yoga|3|Angla|Jolie

3.  There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields.  Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
-----COMMAND-----
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment 
FROM reviews
JOIN businesses
ON reviews.busisness_id = businesses.id
JOIN users
ON reviews.users_id = users.id
;
-----OUTPUT-----
Bradford|Pitt|The Beagle Nightclub|4|Pretty good.
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|ok
Angla|Jolie|Lotus Yoga|5|Amazing!

4.  How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?
-----COMMAND-----
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment 
FROM reviews
JOIN businesses
ON reviews.busisness_id = businesses.id
JOIN users
ON reviews.users_id = users.id
WHERE reviews.busisness_id = 1;
-----OUTPUT-----
Bradford|Pitt|The Beagle Nightclub|4|Pretty good.
