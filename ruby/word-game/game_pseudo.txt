*Create a Wordgame class.
*Store attributes for the word to be guessed, the hidden version of the word to be displayed, the number of moves played, and whether the game is over or not.
*Allow user to input word, and set turn limit based on word length.
*If the number of turns meets the turn limit, the game is over and the player loses.
*Store the players guesses, and if the guess is a repeat do not advance the turn count.
*If the player guesses the word before the turn limit, the game is over and the player wins.
*Update and display hidden version of the word on each turn.
