The HTML5 semantic tags allow you to orgainze the website for styling purposes. the article and section tags seem most useful since most of your content will be contained in those elements.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? 
By default the browser will display elements as the appear in the HTML document, but that can be changed later on with CSS.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? 
I learned how to create a snippet. I will definitely be creating more snippets in the future, snippets can allow you to work more efficiently.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I was confused by how to use the semantic tags.  I can improve my understanding of this concept by doing more research on my own and by practicing using these elements.
